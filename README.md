# Neck to Neck

Neck to Neck is a 2D platformer where you guide 2 heads to the top of the level. The heads are connected by a stretchable neck and constrained by its length. You can either play solo or set up a server to play over a network. The game is loosely based on Japanese folklore.

## Starting a networked game

1. Unzip files from `NeckToNeck.zip`.
2. Run `NeckToNeck.exe`.
3. Click `Host` button to start the server.
4. Find your IP address. If you are planning to run a LAN server and using Windows, you can run the `ipconfig` command from command line. Your local IP should look something like `192.168.1.228`. If you are planning to run a server open to the Internet, you can go to somewhere like [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com) to figure out your public IP address.
5. If you are running a server open to the Internet, you may have to set up port forwarding on your router so that clients can connect to you. The Neck to Neck server runs on port 6510.
6. Run another instance of `NeckToNeck.exe`.
7. Type IP address in game.
8. Click `Join` button to start a client.
